- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Robert Lemke.I have 40 years of programming experience. Apart from specialising in data modelling and business analysis. I have privately been researching better ways to deliver information. Programming is, to me, laborious, clumsy and secular. To reach 'bedrock' there had to be a better way. 
Understanding the material world and biology teaches that all material constructsa are  built from atomic constituents and that these constituents have specific relationships - one to the other, each to others.
Delivering information can be equated to these atomic components - logic being the one (transient) aspect, rule (data) being the second. 
Together, these are combined to form a structure, one structure forming relationships with others, until untlimatly a final monolithic view is delivered.
A fundamental difference between the material constructs in the physical world (and also reflected in the modern OOPS languages) is the hierarchical nature of the construct against the networking capability of a 'bedrock' solution.
A 'bedrock solution has no redundancy in logic at all! A single absolute algorithm exists at the atomic level. This same algorithm is reused in terms of the relationships to others when constituting a delivered information solution - the monolithic 'view' presented to the user. 
To read more, please google "Robert Lemke PhD north west university" and download the MSc dissertation for background, and the thesis for detail.
This project will be developed to incorporate the research mentioned above.
