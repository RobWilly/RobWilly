- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Robert Lemke.I have 40 years of programming experience apart from specialising in data modelling and business analysis. I have privately been researching better ways to deliver information. Programming is, to me, laborious, clumsy and secular. To reach 'bedrock' there had to be a better way. 
Understanding the material world and biology teaches that all is buit from atomic constituents and that these constiruents have specific relationships - one to the orther, each cluster to others.
Delivering information can be equated to these atomic components - logic being the one (transient) aspect, rule (data) being the second. 
Together, these are combined to form a structure, one structure forming relationships with others, until untliamtely a final monolithic view is delivered.
